# Football Player Valuations

**Aim: Predict the market value of football players**

This directory consists of a python notebook (`.ipynb`) and two python files (`.py`). The notebook explores the dataset and compares and analayses various machine learning techniques. The python file called `football_transfer_predictor.py` runs the chosen regression model on a new set of football player data and predicts their market value. To play with the prediction model, you can change the data in the `new_player.csv` file. The other python file called `football_transfer_prediction.py` is the same as the notebbok but as a pure python file.
