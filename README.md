# Football Player Valuations

**Aim: Predict the market value of football players**

This directory consists of a python notebook (`.ipynb`) and two python files (`.py`). The notebook explores the dataset and compares and analayses various machine learning techniques. The python file called `football_transfer_predictor.py` runs the chosen regression model on a new set of football player data and predicts their market value. To play with the prediction model, you can change the data in the `new_player.csv` file. The other python file called `football_transfer_prediction.py` is the same as the notebook but as a pure python file.

### Prompt
Dear students,
The session on Wednesday 20th February, on Practical Application Case Study, is a practical
working group session.
For this practical working group session you will need to work in groups and apply the material
already learnt to a practical problem of your choice. In contrast to previous non-class learning
sessions, the assignment for this one will stay open beyond today. You should work in groups on
the assignment in the teams already assigned.
The assignment is to be submitted on 20th March 2023. Each group should then present the
results of their assignment during the face-to-face session on 24th March 2023.
According to the syllabus: "The group assignment will consist of practical application of the
learning techniques learnt to specific datasets. Evaluation of the group work will be both for the
discussion and decision taking (20%) and for the presentation (20%)."
The assignment involves:
1. selecting a dataset -- with an associated problem -- for which machine learning solutions
may provide interesting insights
2. preparing the dataset in the best possible manner (cleaning, normalising, feature
selection...)
3. selecting a set of machine learning techniques that might be applicable to the dataset
(this may involve applying different competing techniques to address the same task)
4. running the selected set of techniques on the dataset to the best advantage (trying for
different configurations of parameters, applying intermediate validation on part of the
dataset...)
5. comparative analysis of the different solutions applied, leading to a set of conclusions
concerning the most suitable solution
6. informed reflection on how the application of machine learning solutions provide
insights useful for addressing the underlying problem
The submission for the assignment should include:
- a Jupyter notebook covering the six points above
- the set of pure Python programs required to address each of the tasks
You are encouraged to search the Internet for ideas, datasets and for code to reuse. However,
keep in mind that your submissions will be graded on originality as well as on correctness. If you
find good material applicable to your problem, make sure it is (correctly) combined with other
elements to ensure your submission has added value of its own.
(To facilitate interaction across the group and submission of the material, I highly recommend
the use of a GitHub site for the project. I have noticed in the past that students were using
GitHub and it seems a pity not to take advantage of that. If you do not know what I am talking
about, do not worry and proceed as you would have without this paragraph.)
Best regards,
Pablo
